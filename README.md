An app created implementing the Giphy API.

## Random Giphy Generator

This app allows the user to generate 10 random gifs relating to the tag buttons they click or allow them to their own topic in the input field.

The giphy generator will show the user random still gifs, their rating, and a favorite button. They can click on the gif to start and stop the animation and the star to add the gif into the favorite giphy section.
